Irene Irungu is a Doctor of Financial Mathematics at Karatina University. Her research interests include financial time series modelling, risk modelling, statistical inference and machine learning. As the academic leader for the BSc in Actuarial Science programme, she is involved in the development and review of curricula, teaching, advising and mentoring students as well as conducting research activities. In addition, serves as a patron of the Karatina University Actuarial Science students in which she supports the organisation of professional development trainings for students.


As a trained Statistician, she benefits from knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts such as time series analysis, regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage. She also has knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques such as clustering, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks and support vector machines and their applications. Coupled with this knowledge is the experience in developing the corresponding algorithms using statistical computing languages such as R, Python and SPSS. She is continously involved in training on R and SPSS.
